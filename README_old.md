This README is for the Getting and Cleaning Data class project at Johns Hopkins University.  The data used for 
this course can be downloaded at the following website.  
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This repo contains the following three files.  
- run_analysis.R
- README.md
- CodeBook.md

This README file contains links to the data used and specific steps taken to process the raw data taken from the 
above mentioned website.  The run_analysis.R contains the actual code used to process the data from the
downloaded raw dataset to the tidy data set that it produces.  The CodeBook.md contains information about
the variables and information about how I have chose to summarize the data.
